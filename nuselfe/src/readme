Developer's notes:

(1) Download the tar balls and retrieve the source code, utility code, libraries, and two simple tests;
(2) study Makefile;
(3) build graph partitioning library ParMetis - follow instruction inside;
(4) make executible;
(5) repeat the two sample tests: (a) adjust_test.tar.gz (Adjustment under gravity); 
    (b) biotoy test (biotoy.tar.gz) for coupling with EcoSim. 

About the source code (v3.0b): 
(1) Options still missing: 
  (a) better inundation algorithm (inunfl=1);
(2) Input files: the main differences between serial and MPI version are in param.in, hotstart.in 
    and nudging inputs for S,T. Note that param.in now uses a free format; see user manual for details.

How to run:

Remember to make a subdirectory inside the run directory call 'outputs/'
where all process-specific outputs are stored.

On Intel, 

mpirun -np 24 -machinefile mfile pelfe

where mfile is a list of machine names. Ask your system manager if your system is different.

A more efficient and convenient way is to use the simple perl script 
 run_mpi.pl (included in the bundle). It will automatically combine outputs
 while the run is still on-going. You may need to make some simple changes inside
 the script (e.g., update the location of combine_output4 etc). If the run is successful,
 all combined outputs can be found in the directory outputs/.

Postprocessing:

Currently each process will spit out results
 within its own subdomain, and the code combine_output4.f90 can be used to gather these files
 into one global output. Use the simple perl scripts (run_mpi.pl 
 or autocombine_MPI_before_run.pl) to do the combining automatically. 

Most outputs are process-specific. This is the case for hotstart outputs as well, and so in order to hotstart, you need to combine outputs into one hotstart.in
 using combine_hotstart3.f90.
